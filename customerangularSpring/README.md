###Overview
===========

It is simple example with AngularJS with DataBase here I am covering:
- Jersey with Spring Framework 
- AngularJs with Jersey 
- Hibernate for persistence 
-  MySql 5 

The objetive here is show how is easy to communicate AngularJS with any server side technology. For example I could change from Jersey to Spring MVC. And It is not required I change my front-end(AngularJS) and service layer. AngularJS does not mind what is being using in server-side it is expecting JSON Object for communication with server-side. It is amazing, isn't ?

Note: I am improving this application day by day.
